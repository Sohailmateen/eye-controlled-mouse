# Eye-Controlled Mouse Using Python

## Overview

The Eye-Controlled Mouse project utilizes computer vision techniques to enable users to control a mouse cursor using their eye movements. This innovative approach can assist individuals with mobility impairments, allowing them to interact with digital environments without the need for hands.

## Features

- **Hands-Free Control**: Navigate the cursor using eye movement.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple setup and intuitive usage.
- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Adjust sensitivity settings according to user preferences.
- **Compatibility**: Works with most webcams, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the control functionalities.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision that processes video input and detects eye movements.
- **mediapipe**: A framework that provides high-fidelity face and eye tracking.
- **PyAutoGUI**: A library that simulates mouse and keyboard actions, allowing control of the cursor on the screen.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eye-controlled-mouse.git
   cd eye-controlled-mouse
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**
